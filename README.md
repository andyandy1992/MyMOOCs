#<a name="remarks">Remarks</a>:
- Notes are generally written with [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/), and compiled into PDF Documents. Code is generally omitted (following "honor code" agreements).
- I have created a [github page](http://andyandy1992.github.io/MyMOOCs/) for easier viewing/navigation of my PDF notes.
- Although the structure of my notes follow the course structure, additional notes have been added as I read books/papers about the topics - these are usually indicated by footnotes, referencing the sources I obtained such information from.
